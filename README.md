# MyWorkoutApp

This project aim to help me (and you?) follow my workout progress !

The main goal is to be able to track and record each of my workouts, adding new movement, new exercise from 
existing movement or new ones and building a full personal and customisable workout session and program ! 

### Todo:
- [x] initiate README
- [x] install dev environment (prettier, husky)
- [ ] create DB: movement
- [ ] create DB: exercise
- [ ] create DB: workout
- [ ] create DB: program
- [ ] create graphQL schemas
- [ ] tests? One day for sure...

N.B: This will only be the Back-End part. If you're interested in doing the Front-End part, feel free to reach me !
